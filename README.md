# House-Predicting-Prices-Task-4-
In this task, a machine learning pipeline was created to predict housing prices based on various features. The dataset was loaded and explored for missing values, with the total_bedrooms column filled using its median value. Categorical data in the ocean_proximity column was encoded using one-hot encoding to convert it into a numerical format. Features were then selected, and numerical values were standardized using StandardScaler for better model performance. The data was split into training and testing sets. Three models were implemented and trained: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost Regressor. Their performances were compared using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² scores. XGBoost showed the best accuracy among the three models. Feature importance for both tree-based models was visualized to understand which attributes contributed most to price prediction. Lastly, a user input interface was created where values for features could be entered manually, and the trained XGBoost model predicted the median house value accordingly.
